    <h2>üë§ Personal Details</h2>
    <p>My name is <b>Mathias Nkereuwem Andrew</b>, but most people know me as <b>Humble Treasure</b>.
    I was born on <b>Saturday, 2nd December 2006 at 10:00 PM</b>, in Idim Ndom Eki, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.</p>
    <p>I am the third child and the last born of my family. I grew up in Idim Ndom Eki, where my story began before my academic journey started. 
    We lived a comfortable life until my community experienced the <b>Idim Ndom war (2018 - 2020)</b>, which changed a lot of things for us.</p>
    <p>I am currently a Year 1 student at the <b>University of Uyo</b>, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.</p>

    <h2>üë∂ Childhood & Education Journey</h2>
    <p>I started school at just 3 years old, attending kindergarten at PCN Primary School, Idim Ndom. 
    By the age of 4, I was already in Primary 1.</p>
    <p>Later, I went to live with my sister, where I continued at Efacon Fountain School, Akpap Okoyong, completing Upper A, Nursery 1 and 2 by the age of 6. 
    After that, I returned to Hosanna Model School, Idim Ndom Eki for Nursery 1, before transferring back to PCN Primary School, Idim Ndom Eki, where I entered Primary 3.</p>
    <p>At PCN, something happened that shaped my story. There was no teacher for Primary 3, and because I was smart and curious, 
    I was tested with a Primary 5 textbook. I read it fluently and impressed everyone. 
    That same year, I was promoted straight to Primary 5 and also registered for the Common Entrance Examination alongside Primary 6 pupils.</p>

    <h2>üéì Secondary Education</h2>
    <p>I began my JSS1 at <b>East Wing College, Awi, Akamkpa L.G.A., Cross River State</b>. 
    Later, I came back home for JSS2, but because there was no teacher in the class, I joined JSS3 at <b>Comprehensive Secondary School, Atan Eki, Odukpani L.G.A., Cross River State</b>.</p>
    <p>I also continued my SS1 in the same school. Afterward, I transferred to <b>Community Secondary School, Ibiaku Ibiono Western</b>, 
    Ibiono Ibom L.G.A., Akwa Ibom State, where I completed SS2 and SS3 in 2020.</p>
    <p>Despite the challenges of changing schools and lack of teachers, I never skipped a single year in my education.</p>

    <h2>üè¢ Work Experience After Secondary School</h2>
    <p>After I finished secondary school in 2020, I didn‚Äôt just stay idle. I worked in different places to gain experience and build myself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Water Proof Company, Calabar</li>
      <li>ToniRance COMPUTING Press, Mbiabong Ikot Udofia, INI L.G.A., Akwa Ibom State</li>
      <li>BTG Enterprise, Mbiabong, Akwa Ibom State</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These jobs helped me build discipline, teamwork, and practical knowledge in technology and business.</p>

    <h2>‚õ™ Faith & Talent</h2>
    <p>I am a member of Liberty Gospel Church.</p>
    <p>In 2022, during the church‚Äôs anniversary program, there was a talent day meant for children in the Calabar branch only. 
    But I boldly sneaked in and showcased my gift. 
    I shocked everyone by reciting over 200 Bible verses, including full chapters recited to the end.</p>
    <p>That day changed my life ‚Äî it gave me recognition, promises of support, and the courage to push further in my education.</p>

    <h2>üéì University Journey</h2>
    <p>In 2023, I wrote JAMB and was offered admission at <b>Akwa Ibom State University (AKSU)</b>, but I rejected it.</p>
    <p>In 2024, I wrote JAMB again and gained admission into the <b>University of Uyo</b>, where I am currently a Year 1 student.</p>

    <h2>üõ†Ô∏è My Skills</h2>
    <p>Over time, I have built myself with different skills, both in tech and creativity:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Programming & Tech:</b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic), Python (basic), Web/Application Testing</li>
      <li><b>Creative Design:</b> CorelDRAW (graphics design), CapCut (video editing)</li>
      <li><b>Special Abilities:</b> Strong memory, ability to recite and retain, public speaking, confidence to perform under pressure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üåç My Vision</h2>
    <p>My story started from Idim Ndom Eki, with humble beginnings, challenges, and victories. 
    From skipping classes through brilliance, to working in companies after secondary school, to reciting the Bible in public, to gaining admission into UniUyo ‚Äî 
    my life has been a journey of resilience, courage, and growth.</p>
    <p>I believe I am more than a student ‚Äî I am a builder, a creative, and a visionary. 
    My dream is to use my tech, design, and leadership skills to create platforms and opportunities that will inspire and impact the world.</p>

    <h2>‚ú® In Short</h2>
    <p>I am <b>Humble Treasure</b> ‚Äî a student, a creative, and a dreamer with a story still unfolding.</p>
